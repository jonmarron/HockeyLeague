Hockey league

A hockey league is made up of at least four hockey teams.
Each hockey team is composed of six to twelve players, and one player captains the team. A team has a name and the history of all games that team participated in.

Players have a number and a position (attacker, defender or goalkeeper).
Hockey teams play games against each other. Each game has a score and a location. Teams are sometimes led by a coach.

A coach has a level of accreditation (beginner, senior, expert) and a number of years of experience, and can coach multiple teams.
Coaches and players have a name and an address.

For reporting reasons, we are interested in identifying
● all the teams that have the same coach in the hockey league
● get the team with the most wins
● what is the number of wins for each team
